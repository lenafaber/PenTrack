# PenTrack

Part of the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) lifecycle involves overwintering in Antarctica. Males incubate eggs for several months while females feed, huddling to conserve energy and warmth. Many aspects of huddling dynamics have been studied already by Daniel Zitterbart and collaborators. However a striking aspect of A. forsteri huddling behavior has not yet been examined: while huddling conspecifics tend to face the same direction. This may allow A. forsteri to pack more tightly due to oblong anatomy, or might provide more shelter from prevailing winds. We propose to model this behavior phenomenologically using a toy crystal model adapted from statistical physics. We propose to do this primarily because we think itâ€™s neat but it may ultimately prove to be a useful model of phase transitions in huddling behavior. 

In this repository you can find the analysis on penguin movement, consisting of their tracks and orientation.
